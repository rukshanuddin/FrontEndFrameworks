| **Keyword**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Class Declaration** | Allows for the use of the word `class` to declare a class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Class Expression**  | Allows for the creation of a class that is either named or unnamed. When using Class Expression, you use the `const` or `let` keywords.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Constructor**       | A special method that is used for creating and initializing an object within a class. When using a `constructor` within a class, you may only have **one** constructor per class, otherwise, you will get an error. When working with `constructors`, you are able to use the `super` keyword to access constructors from Parent classes.                                 |
| **Hoisting**          | This means you can use a function before you declare it in your code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                       |
| **Instantiate**       | This means you are using and defining the properties within the class. To do this, you need to use the `new` keyword to create "new" class object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Generics**          | A `generic` is a component that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one, which allows users to consume these components and use their own types.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Inheritance**       | Allows developers to `extend` existing classes to create new ones by using the information from the existing class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Decorators**        | Provides a way to add functionality to parts of an application or program and are used extensively in Angular. `Decorators`, denoted by the `@` sign, are functions (including necessary parameters) that are evaluated by another function at runtime with information about the declaration. There are several types of Decorators: Class, Property, Method, Parameter. |
