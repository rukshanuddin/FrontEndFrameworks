## Hoisting

One thing to consider when creating a `class`, is hoisting. When declaring `functions`, they generally get _hoisted_, meaning you can use the `function` before it is declared in the code. When TypeScript compiles, the `declarations` move to the top, so the `function` is declared before being called. In the case of `classes`, the `class` **needs** to be defined **_before_** it is used.

Take the following example. In regular JavaScript the following code will function properly:

```ts
console.log(multiplyValues(5, 6));

function multiplyValues(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

This code works because the function definition will be processed _before_ the `console.log()` function is executed. This is called `Hoisting`. Variable declarations using the `var` keyword and function declarations are processed by the JavaScript engine first, regardless of where they appear within the script file.

Classes however do not work this way. You must declare a class _first_ before you can use it. So for example, the following code will cause an error:

```ts
var example = new mathExample();
console.log(example.multiplyValues(5, 6));

class mathExample {
  multiplyValues(a, b) {
    return a * b;
  }
}
```

However if you move the `mathExample` class declaration to the top of the script, it will work:

```ts
class mathExample {
  multiplyValues(a, b) {
    return a * b;
  }
}
var example = new mathExample();
console.log(example.multiplyValues(5, 6));
```
