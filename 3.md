Angular uses a superset of JavaScript called **TypeScript**, created by Microsoft. TypeScript will compile to plain JavaScript which is why it's called a **superset**. Typescript, as an alternative to JavaScript, adds new features, functionality, and rules to the language to make your code more predictable and prevent errors when programming. Some additions from TypeScript have been integrated into the latest version of JavaScript, one example being classes. The most prominent feature of TypeScript is the ability to use static types when programming, allowing the compiler to throw an error before executing the code, this leads to less time debugging and the ability to reason about code faster.

## Installing Typescript

Since your project will be using Typescript, you will need to use NPM to install it. You can use the following terminal command with any operating system:

```shell
npm install -g typescript
```

To check the version of TypeScript and ensure it was installed correctly, use the following command:

```shell
tsc -v
```
