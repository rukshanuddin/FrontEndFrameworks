**Setup**

1. Open up your terminal/command prompt.

2. Run the following to navigate to your Desktop

```shell
cd Desktop
```

3. Next, navigate to the `FullStackWeb` directory in your terminal:

```shell
cd FullStackWeb
```

4. Then, navigate to the `FEFAngular` directory in your terminal:

```shell
cd FEFAngular
```

5. Create a new project folder named [`AngularL02`](./AngularL02) located within the `FEFAngular` folder in your terminal:

```
mkdir AngularL02
```

6. Once the process is complete, navigate into the `AngularL02` directory:

```shell
cd AngularL02
```

7. Run the following to open your new project in VS Code (or you can open the folder within VS Code directly):

```shell
code .
```

8. Create a file named `package.json` and add the following code:

```json
{
  "name": "L01HandsOn",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a project for testing TypeScript code in Lesson 2",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsc && node index.js"
  }
}
```

9. Create a file named `index.ts`. (This is where all of the code you will be testing in this lesson will live.)

10. Finally, create a new TypeScript config file named `tsconfig.json`. Run the following command:

```shell
tsc --init
```

11. Run `npm start` to create the index.js file.

Great! You are now ready to get started learning more TypeScript!
