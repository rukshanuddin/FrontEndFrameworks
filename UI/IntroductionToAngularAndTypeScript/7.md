If you try to do something illegal, like put a number as the value of a `variable ` defined as a `string`, when compiled, TypeScript will report an error.

For example, try running the following code.

**index.ts** file:

```ts
const tasty: boolean = "that was delicious";
```

- Above, the `variable ` tasty is defined as a boolean, but its value is a `string`, and this will return an error.
  Before you even run the code, the intellisense will warn you that the code is incorrect. If you run `npm start`, you will get the following error in the terminal:

```terminal
index.ts:1:7 - error TS2322: Type '"that was delicious"' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
1 const tasty: boolean = 'that was delicious';
```

It is essential to read and understand the errors in your terminal! The above error states:

```terminal
Type 'that was delicious' is not assignable to type 'boolean'
```

Which means that the `string` 'that was delicious' is not the type of boolean.
