Classes can implement multiple interfaces. When implementing _multiple_ interfaces into a `class`, you must separate them by a comma (`,`). In the example, below, class `Bat` implements the `Animal`, `Mammal`, and `WingedAnimal` interfaces.

**index.ts** file:

```ts
interface Animal {
  name: string;
  whoAmI(): void;
}

interface Mammal {
  brushHair(): void;
}

interface WingedAnimal {
  fly(): void;
}

class Bat implements Animal, Mammal, WingedAnimal {
  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  whoAmI(): void {
    console.log("I'm " + this.name + "!");
  }

  brushHair(): void {
    console.log("I must brush my hair to look pretty!");
  }

  fly(): void {
    console.log("Look! I can fly!");
  }
}

let bat = new Bat("Bartok");
bat.whoAmI();
bat.brushHair();
bat.fly();
```

- As you can see above, because the `class` is implementing each of the `interfaces`, it is using the `methods` located within the `interfaces`.

After running `npm start`, the output looks like the following:

```terminal
I'm Bartok
I must brush my hair to look pretty!
Look! I can fly!
```

And there you have it! You have learned about interfaces and a little bit about classes. In the next lesson, you will learn more about classes and TypeScript in general. Great work!
