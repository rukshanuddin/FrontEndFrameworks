# Static Typing

Arguably, one of the main reasons for the creation of TypeScript is the support of **static typing**. JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly-typed language, and this means that programming in JavaScript does not require the developer to specify the _type_ of `value` used. The type of data can be changed later in the source code or during execution of the program which may be unintended. TypeScript changes this by adding typings support and making the language strongly typed as you would see in Java or C#. With this feature, you declare types and then the compiler checks that the correct _types_ of `values` are being used. If no _type_ is specified, it will be inferred from your code. It is also important to know that because TypeScript is compiled into JavaScript, the real benefit is for the developer when writing the code. Once it has been compiled, the code merely is JavaScript.

## Common Types

The most commonly used types in TypeScript include the following:

| **Type**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Boolean**            | `True` or `False` value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Number**             | All numeric values are represented by the number type, this includes integers, floats, decimals, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **String**             | Textual data. Just like JavaScript, strings can be surrounded by single quotes (''), double quotes (""), or backticks (``).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Array**              | Grouping of values, this can be written two ways. `number[]` or `Array<number>` which both indicate an array of numbers. As the best practice, you should keep arrays of only one type, even in regular JavaScript.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Any**                | There may be a time when a type is needed, but currently unknown; this is what the **any** type is used for. The **any** type allows you to opt-out of type-checking during the compile-time checks. Using **any** is commonly frowned upon and should not be used if it can be avoided. If the type cannot be determined it is a sign that the problem may need to be broken down into smaller pieces. |
| **Void**               | The _polar opposite of any_. Instead of returning any data type, **void** will return nothing. **Void** is used with functions that _do not_ return any value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Null and Undefined** | In TypeScript, null and undefined have their own data types respectively. When not using the strictNullChecks flag in the tsconfig.json file, null and undefined are subtypes of the other types, meaning you can assign a null value to a number or a string. When using the strictNullChecks flag, null and undefined can only be assigned to void and their own respective data types.               |
