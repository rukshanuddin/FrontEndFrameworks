# Key Terms

Below is a list and short description of the central keywords you have learned in this lesson. Please read through and review any concepts you do not fully understand. Great Work!

| **Type**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **TypeScript**     | Typescript, as an alternative to JavaScript, adds new features, functionality, and rules to the language in order to make your code more predictable and prevent errors when programming. |
| **Static Typing**  | Types can be declared and then the compiler checks that the correct types of values are being used. If no type is specified, it will be inferred from your code.                          |
| **Type Casting**   | Allows for the conversion of a string to a number or a number to a string.                                                                                                                |
| **Type Assertion** | Allows you to officially define the types so when the compiler reads your TypeScript code, it cannot assume anything; it knows the type.                                                  |
| **Interfaces**     | Blueprints of types that are easily reused or updated throughout your application                                                                                                         |
