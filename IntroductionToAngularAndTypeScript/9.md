## Typecasting

At some point, you will need to convert a string to a number or a number to a string and this process is called typecasting. You may have seen this before, but it is essential to know the term for this conversion. Below are examples of said conversions, or **typecasting**.

First, the below example shows the converting of a number to a string by using the `toString()` function:

```ts
const age: number = 32;
const ageAsString: string = age.toString();

const greeting: string = "Hello, my age is " + ageAsString + ".";

console.log(greeting);
```

Above, the number `32` is converted into a string.
Now, if you need to convert a string of a number into an integer, you can use `parseInt()` to then do a mathematical equation, as shown below:

```ts
const age: string = "55";
const ageAsNumber: number = parseInt(age);

const numberCalculation: number = ageAsNumber * 10;

console.log(numberCalculation);
```

The code above will allow you to take the string "55", convert it to a number, and multiply it by 10. The output is `550` within the console:
