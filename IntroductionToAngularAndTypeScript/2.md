# Updating Node & NPM

To get started with Angular, you will need at least version 8.9 of Node and version 5.5.1 of the Node Package Manager (NPM). This is verified by running the following commands inside your terminal:

Node:

```shell
node -v
```

npm:

```shell
npm -v
```

If your system has versions before the ones mentioned above, you'll need to update. You can update via the command-prompt/terminal with the directions below:

**Caution!**

_Please make sure to run the commands specific to your operating system!_

**For Windows:**

1. Download the Windows installer from the Node.js website
   [Windows Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Run the installer
3. Follow command prompts on installer

**For Mac:**

In your terminal, run the following:

```sh
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable
sudo npm update -g
```

**All Operating Systems:**

Verify installed correctly with the following commands in your terminal:

**Node:**

```shell
node -v
```

**npm:**

```shell
npm -v
```

Great, now that you are set up with your Node and npm installs it's time to jump into TypeScript!
