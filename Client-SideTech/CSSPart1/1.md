## What is CSS?

**CSS** stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets. CSS is used to manipulate how the HTML elements look on the webpage. It also makes life easier because you can control many different pages on the site all at once.

CSS is a way to style the HTML and create reusable styles, also called **rules**. These regulations and styles can be added directly to an HTML file by using the `<style>` element. They can also be added to a separate `.css` file and then linked to the HTML file.

The best practice for writing and adding styles to HTML is to create a separate CSS file, and then _link_ the CSS file in the HTML. This way the styles can be used throughout the site, on multiple pages, and updated quickly. You will learn more about the CSS file later.

CSS is called _cascading_ because the styles from a parent element also apply to its descendants. The styles cascade down the element tree from the parent elements to its children and descendants, much like a family tree.

For example, if you apply a font style to the `<html>` element, all other elements and tags in that document will have the same font styling applied to them.
