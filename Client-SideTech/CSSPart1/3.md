# Basic Properties and Values

Now that you have learned how to target an element and define a property, it is time to look at some basic properties that are used in CSS.

Coloring
As you have seen previously, you were able to color the text by setting it to blue which will set it to a predefined blue. You can do this for many other colors.

Additional Info!
If you would like to look at all predefined colors that all modern browsers support, please visit: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value.

But, what if none of those colors are what you want in the project? There is a very easy fix for that. You use something called hex codes. A hex code refers to different RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) values and a # is always needed when using a hex code. #ff0000 is the hex code for red.

Below is what the CSS will look like when using a hex code:

div {
color: #a023ea;
}
We are using a hex code for 'vivid violet'!
You can use either predefined colors or hex codes when you are coloring anything on the page.
