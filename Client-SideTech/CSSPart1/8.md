# CSS Activity 2

Follow the instructions below to practice your newly learned skills!

Requirements
In the index.html file, you will see two divisions (div tags) in the body. Each division contains text that references multiple colors.

Your task is to update the style.css file such that:

The first division has bold text.
The second division has a font size of 1.5 em.
Each word that represents a color should be in that color.
To apply the division styling, add an id attribute and set the CSS for that id selector. Remember, the pound sign or the technical term, octothorpe (#) is used for IDs in CSS.

To apply the color styling to the words specifying a color, add a class attribute to each span enclosing the words and set the CSS for those class selectors. Remember, a period (.) is used for classes in CSS.
