## Numbers

A number variable will store a number and allows you to perform math functions. Many math operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be done with number variables. You can use the same characters for mathematical operations in JavaScript as you would use for regular mathematical expressions. Consider the following code:

```js
var a = 2;
var b = 3;

var c = a + b; //c = 5
var d = a - b; //d = -1
var e = a \* b; //e = 6
var f = e / a; //f = 3
```

The result assigned to the variable c would be the result of an addition operation. The result assigned to the variable d would be the result of a subtraction operation and so on.
