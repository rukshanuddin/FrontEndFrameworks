## Strings

A string is the literal representation of a string of characters. Strings are defined by single or double quotes.

```js
var name = "Jennifer";
var age = "24";
```

**Tip!**
You can have a string that is a number. When you put a number within quotes, it will be read as a string.

Above, two variables are declared using the var keyword. One variable is named name while the other is named age. Both variables contain string values. The first, contains the value of Jennifer and the second variable contains the value of 24. Understand that the age variable contains a STRING of the value 24 and not the number 24. This is an important distinction you will learn about later on.

Now that you know how to declare a variable and set it to a string, you can join two strings together through concatenation. To merge two strings together you use the + symbol. This will combine the two strings together. Consider below:

```js
var name = "Jennifer";
var age = "24";

var join = name + age; //the value of join will be "Jennifer24"
```
