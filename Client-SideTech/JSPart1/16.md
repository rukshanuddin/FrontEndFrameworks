There is one more topic to discuss about if statements; that is the else if statement. The else-if condition will be checked when the first if statement is not true but before going to the else code. If the condition within the else-if statement is true, then the code block proceeding the condition will be executed instead. This allows multiple pathways your code could follow based on different conditions. Here is an example:

```js
var puppy = "Lassie";

if (puppy === "Spot") {
  alert("Hi Spot! You are so cute!");
} else if (puppy === "Lassie") {
  alert("That's not Spot, that's Lassie!!");
} else {
  alert("That's not Spot. Is that a cat??");
}
```

In the code sample above, the alert "That's not Spot, that's Lassie!!" will be executed.
