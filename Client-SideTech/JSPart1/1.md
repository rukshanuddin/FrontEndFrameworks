In this lesson, you will begin to add interactivity to your web pages. This is accomplished by writing commands in a programming language that can be interpreted by the web browser. There is only one programming language that is understood by all browsers. That language is JavaScript.

Here are just a few things you can do with JavaScript:

- Create a pop-up error message when an incorrect value is entered in an HTML form field.
- Display an animated slideshow of images.
- Enable a customer to page through a catalog of products.
- Show a notification when you receive a new message.
- Create a chat room.
