# If Statements (Continued)

At the end of an if statement you can add an else statement to provide code you wish to perform if the condition within the if statement is NOT true. The else statement is always tied to an if statement as it cannot stand alone. Here is an example of using an if and else statement:

```js
var puppy = "Nermal";

if (puppy === "Spot") {
  alert("Hi Spot! You are so cute!");
} else {
  alert("That's not Spot. Is that a cat??");
}
```

The code above is checking to see if the puppy is indeed "Spot" and triggering an alert. If the puppy is NOT “Spot”, the else statement kicks in and alerts something different. Notice how the else statement does not have conditions within parenthesis. Else statements do not need conditions because if the conditions are not met in the if statement, no matter what else, the code inside the else statement will run.
