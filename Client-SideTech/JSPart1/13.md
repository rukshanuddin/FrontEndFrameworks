if statements allow you to execute code only when certain conditions are met. Consider a scenario where you would like to set an alarm so that you will not be late to work. The logic in an if statement is as follows: if x is true then do y. For this scenario, if it is the specified time, trigger the alarm. It is time to look at some pseudo code (pseudo code is a description of code using English):

```sh
if currentTime is 6:00AM
  then Wake Up!
```

There are three main parts to an if statement:

The if keyword.
The conditions that need to be met in order for the statement to be true. Those conditions are located within parentheses.
The code to be executed if the conditions are met. This code block is usually located within curly brackets immediately after the condition.
See the diagram below:

The JavaScript engine checks to see if the conditions within the parenthesis are met, and if they are, it then executes the code block.

Looking at an example of a simple if statement. Consider below:

```js
var puppy = true;

if (puppy) {
  alert("That puppy is so cute!");
}
```

Above it is checking to see if the variable 'puppy' is true, and if it is, then you are alerting that the puppy is cute.
