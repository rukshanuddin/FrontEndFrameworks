# JavaScript vs. Java

JavaScript is often confused for Java and vice-versa. This confusing name is not entirely an accident. When JavaScript was first being developed at Netscape, it went through the names Mocha and LiveScript. The company wanted it to have wider appeal. To do this, they licensed the name Java from Sun Microsystems and renamed LiveScript to JavaScript. This allowed Netscape to piggyback off the success of the rapidly expanding Java language. So, while the names are similar, there is very little in common between the two.

JavaScript has since undergone a lot of changes as its importance to the Internet has expanded. JavaScript is now a standard under the ECMA organization and is referred to as ECMAScript. You've probably seen JavaScript referred to as ES5, ES6, or ES2016. That is short for ECMAScript 5/6/2016, which refers to various versions of the standard.

The question of what features are in which version is a rather large, rapidly changing topic. You can check out what features are in each version of the standard, as well as the browsers and runtime that support them here:
