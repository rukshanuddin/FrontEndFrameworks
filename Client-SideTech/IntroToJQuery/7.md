You can complete many tasks with JavaScript. When carrying out these tasks, you work with different types of data. There are three main types of data: **String**, **Number**, and **Boolean**.

- A `String` is a group of words, like a sentence. When writing a String in JavaScript, you need to wrap the group of words you are using within quotes.
- A `Number` is just that, a number. Unlike a String, a Number does not need to be wrapped in anything. If you write out a number, like 24, it will be read as a number automatically.
- A `Boolean` is a logical entity and can only have two values: true and false. A Boolean is like a Number in that it does not need to be wrapped in quotes. If you set something to true without quotes, the value will be interpreted as Boolean.

Below are examples of each of these three types written in JavaScript:

```js
//String
"I am a sentence and in JavaScript, I am called a String";

//Number
24;

//Boolean
true;
```
