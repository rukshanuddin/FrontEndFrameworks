## Border Property

The border CSS property is a shorthand property for setting one or more of the individual border properties border-width, border-style (required) and border-color into a single rule. They will be listed in that order. Consider below:

p {
border: 5px solid blue;
}
The output of the above will be:

This is a paragraph using the border property

Tip!
If the value for an individual border property is omitted or not specified while setting the border shorthand property, the default value for that property will be used instead, if any.
