In JavaScript arrays are a data type just like numbers and strings are a data type. As with all data types in JavaScript, they hold special attributes called "properties". Properties give us information about the data a variable contains. The syntax for accessing a property is to first give the name of the variable, then use a period to indicate you are accessing a property of that variable. Then finally give the name of the property you want the value of. As an example, one useful property on an array is the .length property.

### .length

The .length property will return how many values are within the array.

````js
var colors = ["yellow", "blue", "red"];
colors.length; //the length of colors is 3
```js
var numbers = ["7", "2", "9", "5"];
numbers.length; //the length of numbers is 4
````

The syntax for accessing the .length property follows the pattern of variableName.property. You specify the name of the variable first, in the last example we are accessing the numbers array, then use a period and the name of the property. In this case we access the .length property. So altogether the code numbers.length will return the value of 4.

This use of the period between variable names and their properties is known as "dot notation". Dot notation uses a period to indicate you are trying to access information one layer down from the parent item, or information about that parent item. It is used in many programming languages such as C, PHP, Java, and Python. Dot notation actually has origins in mathematics as you've no doubt used it to access tenths, hundredths, or even thousandths of a whole number. It is useful to think of properties in this way. You are accessing lower level details about a larger parent thing, just as using .1 indicates one level lower than a whole number.

Tip!
You will be learning during Lesson 8 of Coding From Scratch how to display values on your HTML page.

## Array Methods

So far you've learned that data types, like arrays, can have properties that give us access to information about that variable. Properties don't always return information however, they can also be designed to perform specific behavior on a variable. These properties that perform a behavior are called methods. Let's look at a an example of a method called the .sort method.

### .sort()

The .sort() method will sort the array and return another array. When working with strings within an array, it will sort the string values in alphabetical order. Consider below:

```js
var colors = ["yellow", "blue", "red"];
colors.sort(); //the new array will be ["blue", "red", "yellow"]
var numbers = ["7", "2", "9"];
numbers.sort(); //the new array will be ["2", "7", "9"]
```

Notice how our use of .sort() has parenthesis unlike .length. That is because with .sort() you are telling the code to perform an action instead of asking for data. As we saw with the examples of console.log() and alert(), the code is performing a pre-determined behavior. The use of parenthesis helps us as developers recognize that we are telling the code to perform an action, but also JavaScript interprets parenthesis in this same way. If we did not use the parenthesis, we would be asking for the value of that method rather than telling it to execute the method.

### .push()

The .push() method will add a new value to the array. See below:

```js
var colors = ["yellow", "blue", "red"];
colors.push("purple"); //the new array will be ["yellow", "blue", "red", "purple"]
var numbers = ["7", "2", "9"];
numbers.push("5"); //the new array will be ["7", "2", "9", "5"]
```

The .push() method will push the new value to the end of the array.

### .pop()

The .pop() method does the opposite of .push(): it will remove the last element from the array. See below:

```js
var colors = ["yellow", "blue", "red"];
colors.pop(); //the new array will be ["yellow", "blue"];
var numbers = ["7", "2", "9"];
numbers.pop(); //the new array will be ["7", "2"]
```

Keep in mind there are many things arrays can do. There are other properties and methods dedicated to arrays, but these are the basic ones. For now we simply want you to get comfortable with the idea of properties and methods. They are a principle concept of JavaScript and many other programming languages.
