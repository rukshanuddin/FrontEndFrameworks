In the last lesson, you learned how to set a variable to a single value â€” either a string, number, or boolean. Arrays are used to store multiple values within one variable. When defining an array, the values are placed within square brackets ([]).

Consider the following code that uses 3 separate variables to declare 3 different but related values:

```js
var color1 = "yellow";
var color2 = "blue";
var color3 = "red";
```

This code is obviously inefficient. With an array we can combine all three values into one variable. See below:

````js
var colors = ["yellow", "blue", "red"];
Notice how a comma separates each string value. If you wanted to have an array of numbers, it would look very similar:
```js
var numbers = [1, 2, 3];
````

You can even create arrays that contain different data types. For instance, in the example below, you can see that myArray contains a number, string, boolean, and even another array!

```js
var myArray = [5, "Hello", true, [1, "Bye", false]];
Note: Arrays that exist within arrays are referred to as "nested arrays".
```

Although arrays are designed to contain multiple values, they can also be empty or contain just a single value:

```js
var emptyArray = [];
var oneItemArray = ["One"];
```
