In this lesson, you will learn about two very important data structures used in JavaScript: arrays and objects. You will also learn about looping, which is a mechanism used to repeat a group of statements/operations. These concepts of arrays and loops work well together since one is a collection of data (arrays) and the other is how we can repeat a process for each of the items within that collection.
