# Retrieving Input Values

When Retrieving DOM Elements, you are accessing the actual element on the page. That element will have properties and methods on it that allow you to perform a behavior or access values related to that element. When you are working with forms, the user will be inputting information within the various input elements. But what if you want the values within those inputs? To capture this value, you would simply append '.value' to the API methods used in the section above. This will allow you to capture values like so:

```html
<input id="firstName" type="text" />
<input id="lastName" type="text" />
<input id="email" type="text" />
<button onclick="getValues()">Get Values</button>
```

```js
function getValues() {
  var firstName = document.getElementById("firstName").value;
  var lastName = document.getElementById("lastName").value;
  var email = document.getElementById("email").value;
  console.log("First Name: " + firstName);
  console.log("Last Name: " + lastName);
  console.log("Email: " + email);
}
```

Like before, this will allow you to retrieve the input values that have the ids of firstName, lastName, and email and set them all to variables.

Now that you have these values, you can display them on the site or use the value again in the code.

The value property on an input will always be a string data type. Sometimes you will need to convert that string to a number. There are a set of pre-defined functions in JavaScript that convert strings to numbers for us. One such function is the parseInt() function. Below is an example of using parseInt() to convert the value of an input to a whole number:

```html
<form>
  <input id="age" />
</form>
```

```js
var age = parseInt(document.getElementById("age").value);
```

If you don't use parseInt(), JavaScript will read the age as a string. So if the user inputs 30, it will be read by JavaScript as "30". By using parseInt(), you are converting the string of the age to a number. So it won't be "30" but it will be 30.
