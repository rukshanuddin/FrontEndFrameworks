# Styling (Continued)

## Using Web Fonts

Another tool available to make sites more accessible to read is the use of web fonts.

Many different fonts are also available online. These font types are available and used by the browser by linking them through the HTML. It is specified in the <head> like this:

```html
<head>
  <link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Encode+Sans+Condensed"
    rel="stylesheet"
  />
</head>
```

Then the font in your .css file can be used like this:

html {
font-family: 'Encode Sans Condensed', sans-serif;
}
There are some fantastic online font resources available to you. The most widely used is Google Fonts. You can access their fonts by going to Google Fonts, selecting the fonts you want to use, and following the directions given for embedding a font into your site. It will give you the exact link tag you will need to add to your HTML page, along with the font-family for your CSS page.
