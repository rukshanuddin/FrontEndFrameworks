For this Hands-On, you are going to create a function and some variables and by the end, everything will be working together. This Hands-On will be graded, so be sure you complete all requirements.

Caution!

Requirements
In the index.html and script.js files, add the following:

Link your JavaScript file to your HTML file
Within your HTML, create a form that has three inputs:
First Name
Middle Name
Last Name
Create a function named nameInfo in your JavaScript file
Within the function, create three variables: firstName, middleName, lastName
Use the DOM to pull in the info for each of the inputs and set it to the appropriate variable
Next, create another variable named fullName and set it to each of the three variables added together
In your HTML, create an empty <p> tag with an id of "fullName"
In your function, use the DOM innerHTML to post the variable fullName to the empty <p> tag with an id of "fullName"
Lastly, in your HTML, add a button that uses onclick to call your function nameInfo
