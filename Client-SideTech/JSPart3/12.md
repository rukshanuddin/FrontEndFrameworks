## CSS Margin

Margin clears an area around the border that separates it from other boxes. The CSS margin properties allow you to set the margins around the sides of an element's box. The margins do not have a background-color, they are entirely transparent.

## Setting Margins For Individual Sides

You can easily specify the different margins for the different sides of an element such as top, right, bottom or left side using CSS individual margin property.

```css
h1 {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

nav {
margin-left: 100px;
margin-top: 45px;
}
There is also the margin shorthand property to avoid setting the margin of each side separately with margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left.

```css
h1 {
  margin: 0px 10px;
}
article {
  margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
}
```

This shorthand notation can take one, two, three, or four whitespace separated values.

If one value is set, this is applied to all of the four sides.
If two values are specified, the first value is applied to the top and bottom, and the second value is applied to the right and left side.
If three values are specified, the first value is applied to the top, the second value is applied to left and right side and the last value is applied to the bottom.
If four values are specified, they are applied to the top, right, bottom, and left side respectively in the specified order.
